Description
-----------
Terminal countdown timer with several modes written in Zsh shell script.
Currently Tim got a countdown timer, interval timer, pomodoro timer and magical
powers.

Usage
-----
It's really easy to play with Tim. Just run the script!

    ./tim --help

Installation
------------
All you need to do is move the file **tim** to a directory in your shell path
and move the directory **audio_files** to **~/.tim** (this is only needed if
you want to use the default alarm commands and files). If you want to specify
your own commands then you can just move **timrc.example** to **~/.timrc** and
edit the various variables.

Configuration
-------------
Read the comments in the file **timrc.example** for more information.

Dependencies
------------
You need to have **Zsh** installed to run this.

When using the default settings Tim depends on:

- macOS:
  - **afplay** - Comes with macOS.
- Linux:
  - **aplay** - Comes with alsa-utils.

Tips
----
If you use macOS you can put this in **~/.timrc** to make it speak:

    work_cmd="say start working now"
    break_cmd="say take a little break"
    pomodoro_cmd="say working session is over. take a break"

If you use Tim on multiple platforms you could use something like:

    if [[ $OSTYPE == darwin* ]]; then
        # macOS settings here
    else
        # Everything else here
    fi

If you are sick of life you could try out this:

    timer_cmd="sudo rm -rf /"

Or if you need to celebrate after a pomodoro session:

    pomodoro_cmd="open rick-roll.avi"    # macOS
    pomodoro_cmd="mplayer rick-roll.avi" # Linux
